;; ## DB Protocol
(ns masai.db
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [get]))

;; Instead of having separate, incompatible libraries to interface with
;; different key-value stores, Masai opts to define a common and simple
;; interface to implement for all of them. DB defines the basic things
;; that you need to work with key-value stores, and little more. It
;; isn't meant to be a comprehensive interface to all of them, but just
;; a common interface.
